This machine has been a power-house and I hate to part with it.
It is still in amazing condition, I bought the current Macbook Pro in December but have still been using my Macbook pro since 2015. I love that computer has all the USB ports and camera card readers, and that I don't need to buy adapting equipment as I do with the current models.

This computer runs perfectly and has no issues.

I want to buy your broken windows or mac computer. Desktop or laptop. Desktop with no monitor? I will buy it. Doesn't turn on? I will buy it. Comes with bios or windows passcode? I will buy it. Easiest way for you to contact me is thru text. Also send me the information of the computer. To make it easy sending a picture of the make and model would help us both out instead of trying to guess what computer you have. I have cash and willing to meet in a public place for both our safety. My price goes based on computer age, ram, hdd/ssd, whats broken and what is not and so fourth. Only buying computers that come with a windows 11 sticker. Also if the Mac is older then 2015 I am not interested.

Do not hesitate to text me for a price.
I prefer text to keep track of who I am talking to.

Enhance the Productivity of Your Staff
The MC561 Color MFP is fast: it prints or copies up to 27 color pages or 31 black & white pages per minute, with the first color page printing in just 8 seconds.1 It delivers color duplex prints or copies at the rate of 14 ppm, black & white at 16 ppm. Its reversing automatic document feeder (RADF) quickly scans both sides of a document, and its multi-tasking capabilities let you set up or perform two tasks at the same time. And, with a duty cycle of up to 60,000 pages per month, this durable device can be relied upon to handle large daily print and copy volumes.

Scan at the Machine or from Your Desk
With the MC561 Color MFP, you can turn hard-copy documents into electronic files by placing them in the RADF or directly onto the flatbed scanner, scan them in black & white or color, and send the scan to a locally attached PC, to the shared directory on the network (without the need for additional software), to an e-mail address or to an FTP site.

You can also remotely preview and scan your documents on your PC via the network connection and TWAIN driver. You can insert a USB memory stick into the port conveniently located on the front of the unit and save scans to or print files directly from the stick. With Direct Print, you can even print PDF files without opening an application.

The MC561 MFP prints and copies in HD Color, an OKI exclusive: multi-level printheads and microfine toner provide more detail, greater color depth and reduced grain, for breathtaking output even on ordinary office paper.

Making Your Job Easier
The MC561 Color MFP is really user friendly. It's network-ready right out of the box and has an intuitive operator panel that's simple to use, with a 3.5"" backlit LCD display that tilts up for easy reading.

Full Functionality at Your Fingertips
The operator panel features a clear, organized array of navigation buttons, a backlit LCD display, alphanumeric keypad, and 1-touch fax dialing keys. A USB port, conveniently located on the front of the unit, allows for scan-to/print from a memory stick. PaperPort software from Nuance easily turns piles of paper and photos into PDF and JPEG files--using the MFP's scanner--and saves them to your computer for future use. OmniPage from Nuance--optical character recognition (OCR) software--quickly turns hardcopy office documents and forms into electronic files for easy editing, searching and sharing.

Document Management Made Simple
The MC561 Color MFP includes ActKey software that lets you move between scan-to tasks--including Scan-to-Folder, Scan-to-Application and Scan-to- PC Fax--with a single click.

In excellent condition and can not find a scratch on it. Toner is not included. Paid just over $2,000 for this guy a year and half ago. Considering no one really needs a $2,000+ printer, Im offering it for $600 obo. Box included and will place back in box when sold.
Heading back to the office so no more need to have this at home anymore. Its a great printer/copier and if you search the model, you will see it does everything you probably need to do in a home office or office setting.

I will throw in a free desk if the price is right.
Its broken down and easy to put together. All the hardware is obviously included.
